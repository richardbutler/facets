# facets

Chainable sorting and filtering for JavaScript collections.

## Support

Facets makes no apologies for requiring ECMAScript 5 support. For legacy browser support, you'll need to enlist the help of something like [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv).

## Installation

Via NPM:

```npm install facets```

Via Bower:

```bower install facets```

## Docs

To follow. For now, see the [tests](blob/master/test/facets.spec.js) and the [annotated source](blob/master/facets.js).
