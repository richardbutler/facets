# facet

Chainable sorting and filtering for JavaScript collections.

## Support

Facet makes no apologies for requiring ECMAScript 5 support. For legacy browser support, you'll need to enlist the help of something like [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv).

## Installation

Via NPM:

```npm install facet```

Via Bower:

```bower install facet```

## Docs

To follow. For now, see the [tests](blob/master/test/facet.spec.js) and the [annotated source](blob/master/facet.js).
